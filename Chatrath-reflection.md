What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
For the most part I felt comfortable with the commands and concepts.  I did get confused with branching at times but understood the overall concept. 

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
I felt that I got a much better grasp of the commands in general.  Going through the whole process and learning what to do when you run into merge conflicts helped solidify all the concepts.  My understand in terms of branching also felt much stronger after completing this session which helped a lot!  

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
A majority of my questions towards the guide were related to the instruction for the session.  My technical questions were mostly regarding branching and when to be in what branch.  

What still confuses you about git?
What confuses me about git is how to correct other errors when one is made.  Attending office hours and learning how to correct each issue on my own will hopefully get rid of this confusion.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
It was nerve racking but good.  Our guide did a great job at answering any questions we had and I learned a lot.
