**What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**

I wasn't really struggling with any of the git concepts prior to the GPS session. The only thing that I could say I struggled with was just getting the orders correct and the shortcuts correct for making a commit, making a push, and making a pull.

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**

The concepts that were clarified were the steps to making a commit. So first creating a branch, creating a file, editing and saving the file, and making the commit. Once you start doing it often you understand more and it becomes easier to understand.

**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**

I mainly asked if I was typing the right commands or making sure I was taking the right step.

**What still confuses you about git?**

Nothing, I'm pretty comfortable with it right now.
**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**

My first experience was good. Me and Jasmeet worked through the assignment together. We worked out the steps together. We discussed what steps we should take before executing them. If I was stuck she was able to help me. She was a great partner during this assignment. Charlotte, our guide, was helpful as well. For the most part she observed and if she saw us doing something wrong or something that would lead to a problem she stepped in and corrected us. She was also helpful when we were unsure of something. We would reach out to her and she would sort out the confusion.
